## About
Chemica is an addon for Create: The Factory Must Grow that aims to implement real-world chemistry and industrial processes in a fun and meaningful way. It brings an array of new materials, items, fluids, gases and recipe trees.

Some of Chemica's current content includes:

- Creation of new types of plastic like PVC and Epoxy Resin
- Production and use of multiple types of acid
- Carbon Fiber processing tree
- Many new ores, metals, fluids & fuels
- Chemical production from various materials
<br>... and much more planned for the future!

## Development
This project is still early in development and content is subject to change.
Once built up, the project will (hopefully) have a full wiki accessible here.
